# Mailenable logreader

### Please note this is just getting underway as of Februrary 7, 2024.

This git contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display abusive incoming IP addresses. This is not integrated with a Mailenable Windows server's firewall to stop brute force attacks; I use a Progress/Kemp load balancer/reverse proxy to protect against incoming attacks. 

If you need automatic brute force protection, check out https://github.com/ljans/shielding. I haven't tried it myself, but looks promising.
